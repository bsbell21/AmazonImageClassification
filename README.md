# AmazonImageClassification

This folder contains the work for my Amazon Image classification project. The purpose of the project was to apply data science techniques to an image dataset, including:

Data wrangling

Exploratory data analysis

Data storytelling

Machine learning

Deep Learning


The goal of the machine learning model is to identify various labels present in satelite images taken from the Amazon rainforest.
The report contains an overview and discussion of all work performed.
