# Amazon Image Classification Project

This folder contains the work for my Amazon Image classification project. The goal of the machine learning model is to identify various types of atmospheric and land cover present in satelite images taken from the Amazon rainforest. The data was extracted from the Kaggle competition: https://www.kaggle.com/c/planet-understanding-the-amazon-from-space

The files are organized as follows:
 - /notebooks - contains notebooks used for EDA, and machine learning as well as all visualizations creaated for the report
 - /models - contains CNN models
 - Capstone 2 - Project Report.pdf - contains an overview and discussion of all work performed.
